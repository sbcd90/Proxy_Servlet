Proxy Servlet

I wrote a small Proxy Servlet which developers can use to solve the CORS issue which they may face while sharing data from/to different domains via AJAX.

Key Features:
=============

1. Solves the AJAX CORS(Cross Origin Resource Sharing) issue.

2. Supports both HTTP, HTTPS

3. Easy to install & run -- Get started in minutes

How to use it?
==============

1. Download the full source code from Github

2. Add all the external JAR files(check the directory "external_files" in source) to build path.

3. Add all the JAR files to WEB-INF/lib.

4. If Username/Password authentication is required, go to Line 53 in datafetch.java & enter your username & password. This may be changed in later versions & parameters may be used for receiving Username/Password from User. The initial version only supports this.

4. Download Apache Tomcat.

5. Host the proxy servlet along with your app.

6. Call the proxy servlet using the following url:

									"/com.sap.proxy_datafetch/sapservlet?url=<THE URL FROM WHERE YOU WANT TO SEND/RECEIVE DATA>"

Future Plans:
=============

To support all other HTTP methods like POST,PUT etc.

Using web.xml Servlet Mapping
